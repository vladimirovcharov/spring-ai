            Book Elon Musk
            When Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed
            him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the
            hospital for a week. But the physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his
            father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist. His father’s impact on his psyche would linger.
            He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an
            exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission, and a maniacal intensity
            that was callous and at times destructive. At the beginning of 2022—after a year marked by SpaceX launching
            thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest man on
            earth—Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. “I need to shift my mindset away from
            being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,” he said.""";
